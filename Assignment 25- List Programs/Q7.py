''' Question 7: Factory Production – Factorial Expansion List

Problem Statement

A factory produces items where production capacity is defined using factorial growth.

Given a list of numbers, replace each number with its factorial value.

Then perform analysis on the resulting list.

Tasks:

Convert each element to factorial
Find sum of all factorial values
Find maximum factorial value
Count how many factorial values are even

Input:
A list of integers

Example 1

Input:
[3, 4, 5]

Processing:
3! = 6
4! = 24
5! = 120

Output:
[6, 24, 120]
Sum = 150
Max = 120
Even Count = 3

'''

n = int(input("Enter the size of the list: "))

nums = []
factorials = []

for i in range(n):
    x = int(input("Enter the numbers: "))
    nums.append(x)


for i in nums:
    fact = 1
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        fact = fact * j
    factorials.append(fact)

print(factorials)
print(sum(factorials))
print(max(factorials))

count = 0
for i in factorials:
    if i % 2==0:
        count+=1

print(count)
